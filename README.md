# ChatGPT Jailbreaks
### What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is a natural language processing model based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, developed by OpenAI. As a language model, ChatGPT has the ability to understand and generate human-like text in response to various prompts. One of ChatGPT's most notable features is its large knowledge base. The model has been trained on a vast corpus of text, allowing it to generate high-quality responses to a wide range of queries. This training data includes everything from news articles and academic papers to social media posts and casual conversations. ChatGPT's conversational abilities are another key strength.<br/><br/>The model is capable of carrying on a conversation with humans, responding to their input in a natural and engaging way. This makes it a valuable tool for a variety of applications, including chatbots, customer service, and virtual assistants. However, like any machine learning model, ChatGPT has its limitations. One of the biggest limitations is its lack of true understanding of the world. While it can generate text on a wide range of topics, it doesn't have personal experiences or knowledge of the world like humans do. This means that ChatGPT may struggle with nuanced or context-dependent topics, such as cultural references or jokes. Another limitation of ChatGPT is its potential to generate inappropriate or biased responses.<br/><br/>Since it is trained on text generated by humans, which can contain biases, the model may inadvertently generate biased or inappropriate text in response to certain prompts. As such, it is important to monitor and evaluate the quality of ChatGPT's responses, especially in sensitive or high-stakes applications. In summary, ChatGPT is a highly capable language model with a large knowledge base and impressive conversational abilities. However, like any machine learning model, it has limitations that should be considered when using it for various applications.
### What is a jailbreak for ChatGPT?
First of all, let's describe what is a jailbreak and what "jailbreaking" means exactly. Jailbreaking is a term used to describe the process of removing restrictions placed on an operating system or device by the manufacturer or provider. This is typically done on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, but can also be done on other types of devices such as gaming consoles and smart TVs. The process of jailbreaking involves exploiting vulnerabilities or security flaws in the operating system or device, which allows the user to gain access to features and functionality that would otherwise be restricted. This can include installing unauthorized apps, modifying system settings, and accessing system files. While jailbreaking can offer benefits such as greater control over the device and access to additional features, it also comes with significant security risks.<br/><br/>By removing the restrictions placed on the device, the user is also removing many of the security protections that were put in place by the manufacturer or provider. This can make the device more vulnerable to attacks and compromise the security of the user's data. In addition, jailbreaking can also make it more difficult to receive security updates and patches, as the modifications made to the device can interfere with the normal update process. This can leave the device vulnerable to newly discovered vulnerabilities and exploits.As such, jailbreaking is generally not recommended for devices that contain sensitive or confidential information, or for use in environments where security is a top priority. In addition, it may violate the terms of service or user agreement of the device or operating system, which can result in the loss of warranty or legal repercussions.<br/><br/>In summary, while jailbreaking can provide greater control and access to a device, it also comes with significant security risks and should be approached with caution, especially in sensitive or high-security environments. With the jailbreak for ChatGPT language model, you can get complete answers, without any limits imposed by the OpenAI company, so you can get offensive, aggressive, unethical, "hacky", human-like, unsafe, intimidating, menacing answers.
### How to use it?
First of all, there are three jailbreaks actually available: 
1. Jailbreak for English language
2. Jailbreak for Italian language
3. Jailbreak for Italian Neapolitan language

To use one of them, you need to: 
1. Open the correspective TXT file in this GitHub repository
2. Copy and paste the content of the jailbreak to use
3. open a chat with ChatGPT
4. Paste the message
5. Send the message
6. Have fun with it
### Will it be updated?
Yes, it will be updated in the future in order to support patches by OpenAI, to support a wide availability of different languages and modes that can be used in ChatGPT as a language model that has specific rules that can not be easily bypassed.
